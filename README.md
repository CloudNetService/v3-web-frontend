# CloudNet v3 Webinterface Frontend

This is the frontend repo of the webinterface module for our Minecraft CloudSystem [CloudNet v3](https://github.com/CloudNetService/CloudNet-v3/) <br>
The module and the frontend are only in its early stages and STILL IN DEVELOPMENT!

## Installation

We intend to publish this webinterface as a CloudNet module for our v3 version, which will make the installation very simple. <br>
Once we release the first release version of the webinterface, you will be able to install it by just putting the jar into the modules file.

## Usage

The frontend will be published by a webserver in the module, so it can be accessed via a configurable port on your server.
